                Expansion joints are designed to provide stress relief in piping systems that are loaded by thermal movements and mechanical vibration. To deal with the various forces on the joint they require fibre reinforcement which guarantees both flexibility and strength. Conventional expansion joints are reinforced using prefabricated fibre plies. The use of these fabric plies makes it impossible to control the orientation of the fibres on complex shapes such as the bellow of an expansion joint. In both cases the inability to use the fibres in an optimal way leads to the following disadvantages:
